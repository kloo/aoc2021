(Dive Together)
My secret was gone
Listen to my heart
Listen to your mind
Listen to your body
Listen to your soul
Cast my heart
Burn your mind
Cast your body

While your soul ain't empty
Burn your soul
Put your mind with your body into your world
Put your world with my heart into my world
Let your world be with your soul
If my world is weaker than your world
Build my secret up

Let my heart be your mind
Let your mind be your body
Let your body be your soul
Listen to your soul

Scream my secret
